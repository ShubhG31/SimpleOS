    (1) When initializing the GDT, the system was boot looping, so we realized our GDT initialize was incorrect, due to the padding not taken into account. After that fix, 
        the system was booting as intended. Finding the bug took 30 mins, as we only had to comment out some kernel code to find it. Fixing it only took 3 lines of code, and was 
        fixed within 5 mins, as we could compare it to the idt intialization code.

    (2) First i include the header file #include “paging.h” in paging.S file, which is unnecessary and causes the assembly code crash. 
        Besides, i wrote #include “paging.c” in the paging.h, and wrote #include “paging.h” in paging .c. This causes that two files copy each other, making the file excessively large.

        Fixed: we only need to add #include “paging.h” in paging.c file.

    (3) The RTC was not triggering interrupts as intended. TAs had told us what the intended output of the RTC is suppose to be. After comparing with our Keyboard interrupt, we realized 
        that we forgot to make an assembly handler for the RTC, so it was not working as intended. The fix took 10 lines of code, but took an hour and a half to find.

    (4) It is a misunderstanding not a bug. We only need to initialize the table pointing to video memory and the directory pointing to 4MB pages, instead of all 4GB pages.

        For comparing and open file, we need to take care that this file name exceeds 32 length. If we simply use printf to print out its name, there will be a smile character behind it. This is because printf will stop only when meeting the \0, so it will keeps going to the next memory space and print out the smile face.
        Therefore, i write my own compare function to only compare at most 32 characters.

    (6) file_open(“frame0.txt”);
	There is a warning.
	The reason of this is, in c, the string is stored as char array which is counted as int8_t type, but the parameter type should be uint8_t as required, so we need to add some casting when we process the function.

    (7) For testing cases, we need to separate them into functions.
	I did not set set test cases for read_dentry_by_index, because i will call this function when i use read_dentry_by_name. If that works, it means both of two functions works well.
